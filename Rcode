#R code for Open Day activity - March 2024

#Start by setting your working directory

###########
#Activity 1
###########

data<-read.csv("Hospital_adverse_events_data.csv", na.strings = "")

#Firstly, let's use the code below to determine the number of
#patients with the outcome.
table(data$ACE_outcome)

#Because the outcome is coded 0=no and 1=yes we find that 759
#patients experienced an ACE. Next, we can determine the proportion
#of patients with the outcome using the code below.
mean(data$ACE_outcome)

#Next, box plots display the relationship between a categorical
#variable (like our outcome) with a continuous one (e.g., weight).
#Run the code below, then create some box plots between the outcome
#and other continuous variables.
boxplot(data$Body.Weight~data$ACE_outcome)

#Lastly, to assess the association between our categorical outcome  
#with binary predictors, we can use a cross-classification table.
#Use the code below to check for an association with asthma,
#then experiment with some more.
prop.table(table(data$Asthma,ACE=data$ACE_outcome),1)

#Activity 2

data<-read.csv("Hospital_adverse_events_data.csv", na.strings = "")

#For K-means analysis, we make a smaller data set of a few interesting 
#variables among patients with ACE (click on data to view the variables)
data<-data[which(data$ACE_outcome==1),c(2,8,10,11,13,17)]

#Install and load a package for performing K-means analysis
install.packages("factoextra", dependencies=TRUE)
library(factoextra)

#Now lets see what we find if we search for three clusters
#We use the kmeans function and specify the data and number of clusters
set.seed(123)
clust.3<-kmeans(data,centers = 3)

#Next, we inspect how the clusters differ by the variables and how many
#patients belong to each cluster
clust.3$centers
table(clust.3$cluster)



###########
#Activity 3
###########

data<-read.csv("Hospital_adverse_events_data.csv", na.strings = "")

#Lets start by removing some variables we don't want to include
#and rename one to make its name smaller
data<-data[,c(-1,-3:-5, -217,-218)]
names(data)[137]<-"salmeterol"

#Next, lets install and load two packages we need for this activity
install.packages("rpart")
install.packages("rpart.plot")
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)

#next we run the algorithm to construct the tree
tree.mod<-rpart(formula=ACE_outcome~.,data=data, cp=0.0015)

#Now plot the tree
rpart.plot(tree.mod, type=5)
